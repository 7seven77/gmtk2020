### Unfortunately due to a loss in the family, we were unable to complete this project and make a submission

Our attempt at a submission to the gmtk2020 game jam with the theme "**Out of control**". 

This is a 48 hour long game jam where you create a game centered around a theme that is given to you.

[More details can be found here](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020)

## About the game

A top down shooter where you must take control of your enemies to survive. Staying inside someone for too long can be harmful and cause you to die. You also slowly lose control of the host's abilites, so be quick and find another person to infest.

## Features

We were not able to implement all the features we wanted but did make good progress during the first day of the jam.

The features we did implement were:

* Enemies
	* Four different types of enemies (And a system allowing new enemies to be created with ease)
	* Three different Weapons (And a system allowing new weapons to be created with ease)
	* Different AI types (While not alerted to the players whereabouts)
* Taking over enemies
* Abilities
  * One ability (Gaining control of an additional enemy which you can use whilst inside another)

Although these features are in place, they have not been implemented in a level, all together
